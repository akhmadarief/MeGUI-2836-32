qaac requires Apple Application Support that is included in iTunes or QuickTime.

1: either install the full package - which can be found here:
http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/

2: or drag & drop the installer file of iTunes or QuickTime onto the makeportable.cmd in the tools\qaac folder of MeGUI
so that the required files will be extracted to the QTfiles64 folder. 
Files in that directory will not be deleted during an update.
Required for this extraction process is an installed 7-zip!
